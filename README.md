## Overview
TODO: Info here.

## Requirements
- iOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.11+
- Xcode 8.2+
- Swift 3.0+

## Installation
TODO: Info here

### CocoaPods
Alternatively, you can install it as a Cocoapod

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1.0+ is required to build CRDKeychain.

To integrate CRDKeychain into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
pod 'CRDCrypt'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Conclusion
I hope this small library/framework is helpful to you in your next Swift project.  I'll be updating as time and inclination permits and of course I welcome all your feedback.
